Reminder:

PRs merged into main will generate a PR in https://github.com/broadinstitute/terra-helm once a week on Monday to update the WDS image deployed to kubernetes. 
After your merge, you must go to this repo and verify that this generated PR and make sure it merged succesfully.
That merge will then generate a PR in https://github.com/DataBiosphere/leonardo.  This may or may not automerge; be sure to watch it to ensure it merges.
