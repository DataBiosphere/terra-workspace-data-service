        # Populate null instance_ids in sys_wds.job with the environment variable WORKSPACE_ID.
        # This change relies on the value of the WORKSPACE_ID env var.
        # If this change is re-run against the same db, but the WORKSPACE_ID value has changed
        # since the last run, Liquibase will calculate a different checksum for the change
        # and fail with a validation error; see https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/changeset-checksums.html.
        # The only change type that is resilient to changes in env variables is sqlFile ... so,
        # we use sqlFile here to be resilient to any future changes to WORKSPACE_ID.
        # See https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/property-substitution.html for info.
