Code in this package is auto-generated by openapi-generator, specifically via the
`generateApiInterfaces` Gradle task.

As a WDS developer, if you make changes to the OpenAPI spec that in turn causes
generated code to change, you are responsible for verifying those changes and
committing the updates.
